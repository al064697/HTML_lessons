<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Defines that this document is an HTML5 document
 All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration
 The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.-->

<html lang="en"> <!-- This element is the root element of an HTML page -->
<!-- lang=""  is used to define the language of the content within the tag-->

<head> <!-- This element contains meta information about the HTML page -->

    <title>Page Title</title>  <!-- This element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab) -->

</head>

<body> <!-- This  element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents,
such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. -->

Hello World! This is my first website created using HTML

<!-- HTML headers are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important header. <h6> defines the least important header: -->
<h1>This is header 1</h1>
<h2>This is header 2</h2>
<h3>This is header 3</h3>

<!-- HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag: -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<!-- HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes: -->
<img src="resources/icon.png" alt="This is an image" width="192" height="192">
<!--
src: This attribute is required and specifies the path to the image you want to display. It can be a relative or absolute path.
alt: This attribute provides alternative text that will be displayed if the image cannot be loaded.
It's also used by screen readers for visually impaired users, and it's considered a good practice for accessibility and SEO.
width and height: These attributes define the width and height of the image in pixels.
If only one of these attributes is specified, the other will be scaled proportionally to maintain the aspect ratio of the image.
If neither attribute is specified, the image will be displayed in its original size.
-->

<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

<!--The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
