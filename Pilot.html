<!--
src: This attribute is required and specifies the path to the image you want to display. It can be a relative or absolute path.

alt: This attribute provides alternative text that will be displayed if the image cannot be loaded.
It's also used by screen readers for visually impaired users, and it's considered a good practice for accessibility and SEO.

width and height: These attributes define the width and height of the image in pixels.
If only one of these attributes is specified, the other will be scaled proportionally to maintain the aspect ratio of the image.
If neither attribute is specified, the image will be displayed in its original size.
