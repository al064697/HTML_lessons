<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:-->

<html lang="en"> <!-- This element is the root element of an HTML page
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.-->
<!-- lang=""  is used to define the language of the content within the tag-->

<head> <!-- This element contains meta information about the HTML page -->

</head>

<body> <!-- This  element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents,
such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. These elements are between <body> and </body>. -->

</body>
</html>

<!-- Remember: In HTML, only the <!DOCTYPE> declaration is case-sensitive and must be written in uppercase.
The rest of the HTML tags, such as <html>, <body>, <head>, and <p>,
 are not case-sensitive and can be written in either uppercase or lowercase. -->

<!--Never forger the end tag for any element if you want to avoid errors.-->
