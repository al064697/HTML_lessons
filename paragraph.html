<!-- HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
A paragraph always starts on a new line,
and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.-->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
<!--With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed-->

<!-- The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element: -->
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>

<!--The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:-->
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

<!-- The <br> tag defines a line break.
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line)  without starting a new paragraph: -->
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

<!-- The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:-->
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  My Bonnie lies over the sea.
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
