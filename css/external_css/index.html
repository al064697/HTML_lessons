  <!-- The <link> tag below is used to link an external CSS file to this HTML document.
  *The 'href' attribute specifies the location of the CSS file.
  *The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between this document and the linked CSS file. In this case, it's a 'stylesheet'.
  *The 'type' attribute can be used to specify the media type of the linked resource, but it's not necessary for CSS as modern browsers can recognize the file type. -->
